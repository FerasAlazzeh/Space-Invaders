# Space Invaders

# Overview

I programmed my own spin of Space Invaders equipped with UFO's, Alien Ships, Alien Mother Ships, different types of projectiles, accurate collision detection, and smooth gameplay movement. I used an Active Rendering game loop like the one used in Notch's famous game Minecraft. This project was one of my favorites to program because it allowed me to show off my creativity, and skill.

You will also have a health bar displayed below your ship to track the amount of health you currently have. Your score will be displayed on the bottom left of the screen. The game will keep track of your personal high score. Upon death press R to restart the game.
